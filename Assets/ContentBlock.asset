    playerInfo: Wild card - wild card can be used in two different ways. The first
      is to choose a second consonant for the same value as the segment he is on.
      The second is to use it in the bonus round to pick an extra consonant, if he
      of course makes it to the bonus round. Million Dollar Wedge - this is a special
      wedge placed on the wheel for the first three rounds. This wedge is usually
      surrounded by bankrupt wedges on both sides. If it is not won during first
      three rounds, it is removed from the table after the third round. If the player
      claims this wedge, he has to avoid Bankrupt until the end of the game, win
      the round and finish as the game champion. This wedge will be placed on the
      bonus wheel instead of the $100,000 envelope. Bankrupt - (black) special segment
      that costs the player all the money and prizes won in that round, any Wild
      cards and the Million Dollar Wedge. There is one Bankrupt segment in the 1st
      round, and 2 in the 2nd and 3rd.
