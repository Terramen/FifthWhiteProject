    ytryrtyr: Rules of Wheel of Fortune
    rwersdfsdfsdf: The main aim of the game is to solve the word puzzle and gain
      more money than all the other players. The game is played with a special wheel
      with 24 segments that determine the dollar value of the called letters. Before
      the show is taped, players draw special colored strips that stand for their
      positions by the wheel. Each game starts with a host naming a category of the
      puzzle, which can be anything from a Thing to Novelty categories.

    ytryrtyr: Rules of Wheel of Fortune
    rwersdfsdfsdf: Players spin the wheel one by one naming the letters to guess
      the puzzle. If some player thinks he knows the word he can use the Toss up
      and buzz in at any time in the game to solve it. If the guess is correct he
      goes on to the next round and gets a prize of $1000 for the first round and
      $2000 for the second. Also, the second Toss up gives a player the right to
      start round 1. The player to his/her left starts Round 2 and the last player
      starts the 3rd Round. If the Toss-up has not been won by any contestants, or
      if all the letters have been revealed without a Toss-up, no cash is won.

    ytryrtyr: Wheel
    rwersdfsdfsdf: Wild card - wild card can be used in two different ways. The first
      is to choose a second consonant for the same value as the segment he is on.
      The second is to use it in the bonus round to pick an extra consonant, if he
      of course makes it to the bonus round. Million Dollar Wedge - this is a special
      wedge placed on the wheel for the first three rounds. This wedge is usually
      surrounded by bankrupt wedges on both sides. If it is not won during first
      three rounds, it is removed from the table after the third round. If the player
      claims this wedge, he has to avoid Bankrupt until the end of the game, win
      the round and finish as the game champion. This wedge will be placed on the
      bonus wheel instead of the $100,000 envelope. Bankrupt - (black) special segment
      that costs the player all the money and prizes won in that round, any Wild
      cards and the Million Dollar Wedge. There is one Bankrupt segment in the 1st
      round, and 2 in the 2nd and 3rd.

    ytryrtyr: Segments
    rwersdfsdfsdf: Cash - if the guess is correct, the player gets the amount of
      cash written on the segment multiplied by the number of times that letter appears
      in the puzzle. Prizes and Gifts - in order to obtain the prize offered in that
      segment, the player has to guess a consonant correctly. Usually the prize is
      added to the wheel at the start of Round 1 and taken away if no one has won
      it before Round 4 starts. The cash value of the prizes and gift tags is announced
      at the beginning of the game. Free Play - this sector allows the player to
      pick a free vowel or to buy a consonant for $500. If the player is wrong, no
      penalty is used and player resumes his turn.

    ytryrtyr: Vovels
    rwersdfsdfsdf: You have probably noticed, that players that do not get a penalty
      on spinning the wheel have the chance to name a consonant. Vowels can be bought
      for extra cash. The cost of a vowel is usually $250 and if the player is wrong
      the money is still taken from the account. Players are allowed to buy several
      vowels at once if they wish. If the word does not contain any more vowels,
      the host will tell the players about it and vice versa, if the word has only
      vowels left, the players will be offered to buy them.

    ytryrtyr: Solving the Puzzle
    rwersdfsdfsdf: Players that try to solve the puzzle may do this during their
      turn after buying a vowel or naming a letter. Any incorrect guesses cost the
      player a turn. The player that solves the puzzle is the only one who keeps
      all the money won in this round. If the money amounts to less than $1000, it
      is increased to the minimum game amount of $1000. When the player wins the
      round he is offered the chance to take the Bonus solution. This solution is
      a question associated with the puzzle itself and if the player solves it he
      gets extra $3,000. The game may have a Prize Puzzle that awards the winner
      a trip.

      are free. The players name letters one by one and if the guess is correct,
